<h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h2>

<div>

<p>
    Ok so for example i wasnt going to well in school, year 9 and 10 were the worst 
    i was that kid who went to school to eat my lunch, I never listened in class, 
    I was called the distraction, I was a real good kid just got caught up with the wrong 
    friends and trying to fit in and be “cool”. during the start of year 11 i had 
    applied at Gisborne McDonalds and was successful with my application as a part 
    time worker, Because i enjoyed all the financial freedom (as a teen) i asked my 
    mother if i could go to full time.
</p>

<h2>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision.</h2>

<p> 
    She explained to me that she would prefer me stay 
    in school and get my level 1, 2, and 3 first because it could possibly help me in the future. 
    I had to have a long think about it because it would look good having my level 1,2 and 3s 
    but i also fell in love with making money and being able to buy stuff without asking anyone else.
</p>

<h2>The decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>

<p> The decision i made was to finish school early, i don’t think there was any consequences from that action as 
    of yet. </p>

<h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>

<p>
    STRENGTHS: excited to learn, problem solving, perseverance, enthusiasm.

    LIMITATIONS: sometimes I don’t read the question properly, distracted, shy always asking for help.
</p>

<h2> 
    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might 
    intersect with learning obstacles.
</h2>

<p>
    Perseverance is a good one no matter how hard it gets i still try and try again, excited to 
    learn will always be a good trait for me and my future because it allows myself to give anything a go 
    with a can do attitude.
</p>

<h2>
    Share an example from your experience of where you were 
    trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies 
    you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you 
    would try now, and why.
</h2>

<p>
    So another school example would be when we would get put in groups and have to come up with a topic 
    for something everyone would all have different ideas and they would all argue over who’s idea is better, 
    when we would finally decide half of the group were sulking because they didn’t like the idea, the 
    strategy i used was to let them decide and come in once it had been sorted, it was effective because i 
    avoided their confrontation and once the topic was decided i could add my ideas inside the brainstorm, 
    i would probably still use the same strategie.
</p>

<h2>Strength and Values</h2>

<p>
     My strengths would be Loyalty, Trustworthy, Honest, and care alot about others.
     One of the main things i value most would be my family mainly all my baby nieces and nephews 
     teaching them small things and watching them develope the new skill is the best feeling 
     ever! I come from a very close whanau we all grew up together, respect for our elders was 
     a must and also being a star at making tea and coffee for all the uncles, auntys, nannys and papas 
     at a young age. I remember feeling so neat hearing Mmmmm this is the best coffee ever! probly 
     only said it so i could keep making them, it worked though!
