            <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

        <h2> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity and how it benefits people.</h2>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the understanding that experiences are able to 
            change, it allows anyone to be able to learn a new skill, language 
            or anything new. 9 principals of neuroplasticity are.
        </p>
    <ul>
        <li> 
            USE IT OR LOSE IT: Failure to drive specific brain functions 
            can lead to loss of ability 
        </li>
        <li> 
            USE IT AND IMPROVE IT: Training that drives a specific brain 
            function can lead to improving abilities
        </li>
        <li> SPECIFICITY: The nature of the training experience dictates the 
            nature of the change in the brain (plasticity).
        </li>
        <li>
            REPITITION MATTERS: Change (plasticity) requires sufficient repetition.
        </li>
        <li> 
            INTENSITY MATTERS: Change (plasticity) requires intensive training.
        </li>
        <li>
            TIME MATTERS: Different forms of change (plasticity) in the brain 
            happen at different times during training.
        </li>
        <li>
            SALIENCE MATTERS: The training experience must be meaningful to the 
            person in order to cause change (plasticity).
        </li>
        <li>
            AGE MATTERS: Training-induced change (plasticity) occurs more readily in younger brains.
        </li>
        <li>
            TRANSFERANCE: Change in function as a result of one training experience can 
            even lead to learning other similar skills.
        </li>
        <li>
            INTERFERANCE: Brain changes (plasticity) that result in bad habits can 
            interfere with learning good habits.
        </li>
     </ul>

                A few Ways to increse your neuroplasticity
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    DONT LET THE WORK DAY LINGER: Obviously a good night’s sleep of between seven and nine hours will 
                    always set you up for a better brain day. But a short afternoon nap 
                    of around 20 minutes will elevate your neuroplasticity potential even 
                    further. A short nap encourages the growth of dendritic spines, which 
                    act as crucial connectors between the neurons in your brain. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    EXTEND YOUR VOCABULARY: Try to learn one new word every day. According to experts, this 
                    simple act will spark a multitude of new neural pathways, both visual 
                    and auditory. (Give it a few months and it’ll make you unstoppable at 
                    Scrabble too). 
                </li>   
                <li>
                    TAKE NAPS: I like this one.. obviously a good night’s sleep of between seven and nine hours 
                    will always set you up for a better brain day. But a short afternoon nap of around 20 minutes will 
                    elevate your neuroplasticity potential even further. A short nap encourages the growth 
                    of dendritic spines, which act as crucial connectors between the neurons in your brain.

            <h1> Growth mindset </h1>

            <h2> Discuss what is is and why its relevant </h2>
            <p> 
                In a growth mindset, people believe that their most 
                basic abilities can be developed through 
                dedication and hard work, its relevant to me 
                because during this course i have come across 
                challenges that i have been stuck on for days and 
                without my persiverance i would have given up.
                It makes me realise how growth mindset could 
                effect the way i work now, everything is all new 
                to me to dont be to hard on myself because over time it will 
                all come to me.
            </p>

        <h2> 
            In this exploration, did anything surprise 
             you, change for you?
        </h2>
            <p>
               Nothing surprised me i've always known what growth 
               mindset was but somthing that will change for 
               me is how i can apply this into my daily lifestyle 
               and into my studies
            </p>

        <h2> 
            How will you intergrate growth mindset into 
             your learning journey.
        </h2>
            <p>
                Ill be less scared to go into a task and think 
                of it more of a positive challenge like "yay somthing new 
                i can learn", instead of being horrified thet i dont 
                know anything. TRUST THE PROCESS
