        <h1>Learning plan</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>

        <p>
            My long term goal is to hopefully own my own my own home within the next 10-15 years, and 
           work my way up the salary ladder to be able to be comfortable and live a beautiful life of not ever 
           having worries and be able to travel and also be in a position where i can also financially help 
           my family and others aswell, being my own boss would be awsome aswell but i never really thought it through 
           though 
        </p>

        <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>

        <p>
            STRENGTHS in relation to my learning are things like im always excited to learn somthing new,
            I am a peoples person so i work really well with others and also alone, I have really 
            great communication skills and im always on time.
        </p>

        <p>
            LIMITATIONS in relation to my learning would be i am easily distracted, I struggle with talking to 
            larger groups, I lack in confidence, I do work well with others and have great communication skills 
            but only when im comfortable with them.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in
            yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>

        <p>
            Human skills i would like to develope is my confidence, little things like starting 
            a conversation, having an input within a group, small talk is better then no talk.
        </p>

        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>

        <p>
            Because i have been given the opportunity to give dev academy another go this time my 
            commitment is to do the dev academy, my facilitator Lani, Bridgette and Phil proud, I know 
            its going to get tough but my plan is to push through, this is where my presiverance will 
            come in to play, there is nothing i expect more from Lani she is always a huge help and always 
            does it with a smile, I dont have any commitments throughout the foundations and bootcamp so 
            im good to go. I am greatful for this second chance, the only difference is this time 
            im in it to win it.
        </p>
