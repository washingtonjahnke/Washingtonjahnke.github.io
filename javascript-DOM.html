        <h2>What is the difference between HTML and CSS</h2>

        <h3>HTML is the author and CSS is the artist </h3>
        <p>
            Tell him to draw a basic physical structure of human body. Once he drew, ask him various parts 
            that make up a complete human body. Although a non technical person, I am sure he might be knowing 
            at least different parts (hands, legs, face, etc). Now make that person understand that just as 
            these parts make up a complete human body, in the same way there are some elements/parts which make 
            up a webpage(or website). To be more concise, they are known as HTML tags(imagine as different body 
            parts) without which a webpage is incomplete. Those HTML tags describes the structure (Imagine human 
            body) of webpage(website).

            Understanding CSS…..

            After understanding HTML, understanding CSS is important because if HTML is Romeo then CSS is Juliet 
            without which HTML is incomplete.

            Make that person draw a skeletal structure of human body or just show him 2–3 different skeletal 
            structures. Now ask him can you recognize a person with just his skeleton? I am sure he won't. 
            So explain him. Just as skin (with different colors, types, etc.) makes us recognizable or 
            beautifies our looks, in the same way CSS beautifies an HTML page by adding different features 
            like color, size, shape, etc.

        <h2>Controll Flow and Loops</h2>

        <p>
            Controll flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when, Loops are 
            used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return 
            true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false 
        </p>

        <h2>What is the DOM</h2>

        <p>
            The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser. 
            It represents the web page using a‌‌ series of objects. The main object is the document object, 
            which in turn houses other objects which also house their own objects, and so on.
        </p>

        <h2>What are Functions and how are they useful</h2>

        <p>
            Functions describe situations where one quantity determines another. Because we continually make theories about 
            dependencies between quantities in nature and society, functions are important tools in the construction 
            of mathematical models.
        </p>

        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>

        <p>
            When you need to depend on the order of the elements in the collection, use Arrays, 
            when order is not important, use objects. Order is not guaranteed in objects, but they 
            provide for fast key-value pair lookups.
        </p>

        <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
