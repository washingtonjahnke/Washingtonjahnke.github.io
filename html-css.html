<h1> What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks? </h1>

<p> An inline element has no line break before or after it, and it tolerates HTML elements next to it. </p>

<p> A block element has some whitespace above and below it and does not tolerate any HTML elements next to it. </p>

<p> 
    An inline-block element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), 
    but it behaves as a block element.
