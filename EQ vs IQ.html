        <h2>Describe the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>

        <p>
            Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the 
            ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to 
            relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome 
            challenges and defuse conflict.
        </p>

        <h2>Describe why EQ is important</h2>

        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is widely recognized as a valuable skill that helps 
            improve communication, management, problem-solving, and relationships within the 
            workplace. It is also a skill that researchers believe can be improved with 
            training and practice.

        <h2>What is Mindfullness</h2>

        <p> 
            Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware 
            of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or 
            judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and 
            other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.
