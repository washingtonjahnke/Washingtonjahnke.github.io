        <h2> Discuss what is is and why its relevant </h2>

            <p> 
                In a growth mindset, people believe that their most 
                basic abilities can be developed through 
                dedication and hard work, its relevant to me 
                because during this course i have come across 
                challenges that i have been stuck on for days and 
                without my persiverance i would have given up.
                It makes me realise how growth mindset could 
                effect the way i work now, everything is all new 
                to me to dont be to hard on myself because over time it will 
                all come to me.

        <h2> In this exploration, did anything surprise you, change for you? </h2>
            
            <p>
               Nothing surprised me i've always known what growth 
               mindset was but somthing that will change for 
               me is how i can apply this into my daily lifestyle 
               and into my studies
            </p>

        <h2> How will you intergrate growth mindset into your learning journey </h2>

            <p>
                Ill be less scared to go into a task and think 
                of it more of a positive challenge like "yay somthing new 
                i can learn", instead of being horrified that i dont 
                know anything. TRUST THE PROCESS
            </p>
